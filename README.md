# Motion-Detection-System
A real-time motion detection system using OpenCV, PyQt5, and Pygame. 
This application captures video from a webcam, detects motion, and triggers an alarm with system notifications.
It also allows users to define a region of interest (ROI), adjust sensitivity, and log motion events with timestamps.

Features:
✅ Real-time motion detection using OpenCV
✅ Adjustable sensitivity for precise detection
✅ Region of Interest (ROI) selection for targeted monitoring
✅ Alarm system using Pygame for audio alerts
✅ Motion event logging with timestamps
✅ PyQt5-based GUI for user-friendly interaction

⚙ Usage
Click "Start" to begin motion detection.
Adjust sensitivity using the slider.
Click "Set ROI" to define a specific motion detection area.
When motion is detected, an alarm plays, and a notification appears.
Motion events are logged and can be exported to a file.
Click "Stop" to exit the application.
