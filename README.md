# Motion-Detection-System
A real-time motion detection system using OpenCV, PyQt5, and Pygame. This application captures video from a webcam, detects motion, and triggers an alarm with system notifications. It also allows users to define a region of interest (ROI), adjust sensitivity, and log motion events with timestamps.
